# Milestone Project 1

## UX

### Project Goals
##### The goal of Memory Master is to provide a fun card/pattern matching game that is easy to play. The game is suitable for children and adults

#### Player Goals
##### Player goals are
- A fun game to play
- Easy to understand controls
- Clearly recognisable cards/patterns
- Visual and audio feedback
- A "best score" counter
- Adjust difficulty to suit age and/or time available for play

#### Developer and Business goals
- A game that can entertain children and pass time for adults in waiting rooms
- Programming that will handle unexpected behaviour well, e.g. will double check before resetting user progress
- Add a javascript project to his portfolio

#### User stories
##### As an adult I want...
1. Different difficulty options to suit the amount of free time I currently have
2. To be able to set a high score and try to beat it
3. The number of matches made/remaining to be visible on screen
4. Visual feedback on which cards are already matched

#### As a child I want...
1. To change the difficulty to suit my age
2. Audio and visual feedback on my progress
3. Easily recognisable cards/patterns
4. Acknowledgement when I set a new high score or "good" score (i.e. close to high score)

### Design Choices
##### The game is designed to feel like it is being played on a real board with real cards to help immerse the player. The design choices were made around this theme.

#### Fonts
- The primary font chosen was Permanent Marker. This font appears in a handwritten style and adds to the feel of realism in the game
- The secondary font chosen was Handlee, again because its style is handwritten, but also because it's more compact and easier to read

#### Images
- The card images were chosen as they would be easy to recognise for both adults and children

#### Colours
- The primary colour chosen is green to simulate playing on a green felt board
- Black and red are also chosen as they are commonly used in card games. This will help to immerse the player further

#### Styling
- When the player gets a match right, a green tick is briefly shown over each card to encourage the player
- Likewise when they make a mistake, an x is shown to let them know it wasn't a match

#### Icons
- The icons were chosen to be as simple as possible. This makes it intuitive for both adults and children to understand what they do and allows them to play the game without distraction

#### Audio
- A "swipe" sound is played when turning a card to increase immersion
- A "ding" sound is used to give positive feedback when a match is found
- A small theme tune will play when the player beats their top score
