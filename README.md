# Milestone Project 1

## UX

### Project Goals
##### The goal of Memory Master is to provide a fun card/pattern matching game that is easy to play. The game is suitable for children and adults

#### Player Goals
##### Player goals are
- A fun game to play
- Easy to understand controls
- Clearly recognisable cards/patterns
- Visual and audio feedback
- A "best score" counter
- Adjust difficulty to suit age and/or time available for play

#### Developer and Business goals
- A game that can entertain children and pass time for adults in waiting rooms
- Programming that will handle unexpected behaviour well, e.g. will double check before resetting user progress
- Add a javascript project to his portfolio

#### User stories
##### As an adult I want...
1. Different difficulty options to suit the amount of free time I currently have
2. To be able to set a high score and try to beat it
3. The number of matches made/remaining to be visible on screen
4. Visual feedback on which cards are already matched

#### As a child I want...
1. To change the difficulty to suit my age
2. Audio and visual feedback on my progress
3. Easily recognisable cards/patterns
4. Acknowledgement when I set a new high score or "good" score (i.e. close to high score)
